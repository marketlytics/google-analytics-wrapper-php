Google Analytics Wrapper for Google API PHP Client

===========


This is a simple Google Analytics wrapper for the Core Reporting API which creates a simple class to use over the Google API PHP client library. Plus it adds a few enhancements over the library:


- getting rows with their column names
- using metrics and dimensions as arrays
- using normal expressions for filters.
- One line initiatization
- Batch requests with results processed
