Google Analytics Wrapper for Google API PHP Client

===========


This is a simple Google Analytics wrapper for the Core Reporting API which creates a simple class to use over the Google API PHP client library. Plus it adds a few enhancements over the library, i.e. getting rows with their column names, using metrics and dimensions as arrays, and using normal expressions for filters.
